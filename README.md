## HW3: Reliable Transport Service (pseudo TCP)

This project implements a transport layer service over UDP in three stages:

### Part 1: Handshake
- Basic TCP-like handshake connection setup.

### Part 2: Single TCP-like connection 
- Extends Part 1 by implementing many of the TCP features (dynamic RTOs, fast retxs, checksum).

### Part 3: Multi-Threaded 
- Enhances Part 2 with multi-threading for improved performance.
